Filesystem data consists of data stored in file formats such as `.csv` or `.parquet`, and located in an environment with a folder hierarchy such as Amazon S3, Azure Blob Storage, Google Cloud Storage, or local and networked filesystems.  GX can leverage either pandas or Spark to read this data.

To connect to your Filesystem data, you first create a Data Source which tells GX where your data files reside.  You then configure Data Assets for your Data Source to tell GX which sets of records you want to be able to access from your Data Source.  Finally, you will define Batch Definitions which allow you to request all the records retrieved from a Data Asset or further partition the returned records based on a specified date.

## Create a Data Source

<CreateADataSource/>

## Create a Data Asset

<CreateADataAsset/>

## Create a Batch Definition

A Batch Definition allows you to request all the records from a Data Asset or a subset based on the contents of a date and time field.

:::note For API-managed Expectations only
If you use GX Cloud and GX Core together, note that Batch Definitions you create with the API apply to [API-managed Expectations](/cloud/expectations/manage_expectations.md#gx-managed-vs-api-managed-expectations) only.
